                    <div class="des">Abyss is the first map in VALORANT to have no outer boundaries and a death drop in Mid, making it possible in these areas for players to fall off the map to their death. Some parts of the map can only be accessed by jumping across these drops; the Danger and Secret positions are narrow ledges on the map's outer boundaries that are used as jump shortcuts. In Mid, players can also only get up to Catwalk directly from Top or Library by making a jump over Mid's death drop to an ascender.</div>
